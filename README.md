# Wind Waker Tracker

PopTracker pack for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker

## Installation

1. Add the "ww-poptracker" zip into your poptracker/packs folder.
2. In PopTracker, click on the folder in the top left and navigate to the Wind Waker tracker (pick the Entrance Rando variant if you are using entrance randomization).
3. There are boxes all over the map of varying colors, they represent the following: 
    Green - Can get
    Red - Can't get
    Orange - Can get some items in a given area but not all of them
    Yellow - Can reach by breaking logic (tracker does not account for all of these yet)
4. Poptracker has a broadcast view designed to be used as a display on streams and videos. You can open this popout window by clicking the radio tower button next to the settings button in the top left corner.

## To-Do List

1. Higher resolution maps. I'm still hoping for Temple of the Gods and Forsaken Fortress 3D maps to match other dungeons.
2. More precise location icons on the Sea Chart map.
3. Add more "out of logic" checks" where possible (probably going to limit this to the more accessible methods, nothing too difficult).

## Important Notes

1. The tracker does not and will not support randomized chart locations. The tracker will always display vanilla chart locations on the Salvaging map.
